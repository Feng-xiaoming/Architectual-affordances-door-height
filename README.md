# Architectual-affordances-door-height
For the sake of open science, we shared our data analysis codes from EEG data-importing, preprocessing, epoching, to ERPs calculation codes, and also some useful data visualization codes.
Regarding data importing and preprocessing, EEG epoching, and ERPs calculation, we specified files names.
Hopefully, this codes sharing can be supportive for the related academic community.
Regarding the original preprocessing codes, you can search it by this link: https://github.com/BeMoBIL/bemobil-pipeline. In order to use it, I recommend you read all original codes and README files first.

Last but not the least, in the current project we used subjects with standard/common body height (<1.75m), the subject numbers are: 2-5, 9-14, 16-20, 22, 23, 25, and 26.
